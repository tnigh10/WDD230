      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our biggest joy is the out of doors and we want to share that with everyone. Outfitting others with the proper gear, clothing, tools and equipment so they can enjoy any type of outdoor or wilderness activity is our focus. In addition, our knowledgeable staff are some of the most accomplished outdoorsmen around. We can help to provide tips and tricks for any type of excursion or activity. From vacationers to hunters to special occasions and expeditions, we have been there so we can help you. We will always carry the best brands and most reliable products to serve our customers and to provide the best overall experience.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>While we might like to think that everyone would be our customers, the facts are more likely to be a demographic of 18-45 and middle to upper middle income. Anyone that is going to a lake, park, national forest, wilderness reserve, campground, in the desert, mountains, or whatever type of terrain should be able to find useful products and information here. Even hard-to-find specialty products are part of our service. We also cater to scouting groups and company excursions. Our audience will probably find us using a mobile phone or tablet, but should be equally engaged with extended content for desktop users.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- You are not required to use this logo for your site…but you must have a logo for your website.  I can offer additional logos to use, or you can create your own-->

        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/a18276-fffecb-095256-020887-e77728" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/a18276-fffecb-095256-020887-e77728</a></p>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Helvetica  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I wanted a font that was simple, easy to make Bold or larger and that was very clear.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Times New Roman  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I have always enjoyed reading and Times New Roman is a comforting, relaxing font to read.  <!-- change this -->

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
